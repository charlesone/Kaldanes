There are currently three C++ source code files and three C++ header files in this collection:

1. SortBench.cpp - a benchmark application for measuring the performance (clock time) of
  various kinds of template sort methods (selection, shell, insertion, merge and quick sorts,
  but not stl sort: I could not get past the const bug: "discards qualifiers" on two string types
  when using simple arrays, and could not use the <array> type, because the program dynamically
  changes array length and template numeric veriables must be const across the compile, I believe.)
  
  Different sort methods are used against different array element types (numeric, pointer strings,
  Direct strings and Kaldane Symbiont strings (see below for descriptions of the last two.)
  Various examples of how to operate the SortBench.cpp application are commented out in the main()
  function. Multiple runs are sequentially executed. A catchall event handler is provided for
  release (performance) testing, when you will need it if something goes wrong (and if it generates
  an exception, most of the C++ runtime is the C runtime and does not generate exceptions on failure.)
  
  SortBench is currently set up to compare Direct and Kaldane Symbiont strings with std::string type
  that you get from #include <string>. Kaldane Symbiont stings are across the board faster and sometimes
  thousands of times so. std::string is quadratic for merge sort, Kaldane Symbionts are almost linear.
  
2. SortDemo.cpp - a trimmed down program to demonstrate how much faster Direct strings are than the
  std::string or <string> type for strings 64 bytes long and shorter, and to demonstrate how 
  significantly faster Kaldane Symbiont strings are than the std::string or <string> type ALL THE TIME.
  The results from running SortDemo are prineted below.
  
3. SortQATest.cpp - contains a test to drive the SortDemo-style run in a loop, checking for
  boolean operational correctness on the new types and that the sorted output is actually sorted.
  Throws exceptions if not.
  
4. Direct.h - header file for Direct string type, which are variable-length (with an upper bound)
  null-terminated byte strings that have their bytes moved as a single body when they are swapped
  as in sorting, not just moving their pointers (following the Sort Benchmark rules.) These might
  be a candidate for the Indy Sort. Direct has "value-string semantics" as Stroustrup defined for
  his String type (C++11, chapter 19.3) Direct strings are the fastest for short strings: linear
  for quick sort AND merge sort (as opposed to the type <string> which is slower for quick sort
  and quadratic for merge sort.) However, even for longer strings Direct are sub-linear in time
  complexity for string length due to cache pre-fetch (that means when you double the length of
  the strings being sorted, the time taken is quite a bit less than double.) They are designed 
  to be used  with slab allocation/deallocation on the stack, as opposed to fine-grained allocators.
  Since the allocated slab never needs to contain pointers, the slab data structure is base+offset
  and can be mmapped to a file or /dev/shm and shared locally or across  a memory fabric like Gen-Z,
  or stored and transmitted, or mmapped over an NFS: consistency considerations are an issue for
  sharing, of course (caveat participem).

5. Symbiont.h - header file for Kaldane Symbiont string, which are variable-length (with an upper
  bound) null-terminated byte strings that have their indexes and a "poor man's normalized key"
  (pmnk) moved when they are swapped, without moving their tail strings (ignoring the Sort Benchmark
  rules). Symbiont has "value-string semantics" as Stroustrup defined for his String type (C++11,
  chapter 19.3) These might be a candidate for the Indy Sort. Symbiont strings behave like Direct
  strings for short lengths (32 bytes or less, by internally equating the pmnk length with the
  string length.) This allows Symbiont strings to match Direct strings in performance for short
  strings and still have constant time complexity for any string length: they are a candidate
  for general purpose string programming with stack slab allocation/deallocation as opposed to
  the fine-grained allocators, which are necessary for pointer strings like <string>. Symbiont
  strings are quadratic in the debug build for  merge sort, and linear in the release build for
  both quick sort and merge sort, so remember to use the release build for performance analysis.
  They are designed to be used  with with slab allocation/deallocation on the stack, as opposed
  to fine-grained allocators. Since the allocated slab never needs to contain pointers, only
  array indices, the slab data structure is base+offset and can be mmapped to a file or /dev/shm
  and shared locally or across a memory fabric such as Gen-Z, or stored and transmitted, or mmapped
  over an NFS: consistency considerations are an issue for sharing, of course (caveat participem).
  
6. Sorts.h - header file containing various templated sort methods.

  The name Kaldane is an antique SciFi reference (heads move, bodies stay):

There are also various performancce text data files from SortDemo and big runs from SortBench against the three
data types: Direct, Symbiont and std::string.

The results of running SortDemo on my Centos 7 system are below.

It's a ~$2nn refurbished 15GB HP 6300 Pro Small Format box (from Amazon.com), compiling with commands:
g++ -Wall -fexceptions -O2 -std=c++11  -c /home/charles/Projects/SortBench/SortDemo.cpp -o obj/Release/SortDemo.o
g++  -o bin/Release/SortBench obj/Release/SortDemo.o  -s  
The compiler version is "gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16) (GCC)"

Here are the results of the "lscpu" command on my system:

SortDemo output (the three merge sorts for the std::string type take less than
30 minutes each, because it is quadratic on std:string):

Three different string types, identical in content and
sorting logic, but not in timings.

Note that the number of swaps and compares for identical arrays,
   using the identical code: these statistics should be identical.

Remember to set the C++11 switch in the IDE or compiler!

Remember to use release builds if you are analyzing performance, otherwise Symbionts will be very slow!

Remember to set the "ulimit -s" soft and hard stack limits to unlimited, otherwise it can die!
